ðŸ“Œ Project Description (for GitHub)
This project uses AI and geospatial analysis to help identify potential unknown archaeological sites in the Amazon rainforest. It leverages LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), satellite data, and OpenAI models to analyze terrain features and detect subtle landscape patterns potentially indicating past human settlements.

Optional Add-ons for README.md:
You can also include:

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python, Google Earth Engine, Rasterio

OpenTopography LiDAR data

OpenAI GPT models

Jupyter/Colab Notebook

ðŸ“‚ Data Source
LiDAR data from OpenTopography

DEM & TIN-based terrain models
